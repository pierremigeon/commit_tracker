### Commit tracker
This is repo is strictly for the purpose of tracking commits, so that I can get those sweet sweet green boxes on my github profile when I'm making commits to forked repos. Full disclosure, this directory is updated for any commits that I make, even without pushing those commits to this remote. It's still a measure of my productivity, but it's definitely not completely consistent with github's standard behavior for this metric.
