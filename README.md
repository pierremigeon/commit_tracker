### Commit tracker
This is repo is strictly for the purpose of tracking commits, so that I can get those sweet sweet green boxes on my github profile when I'm making commits to forked repos. Full disclosure, this directory is updated for any commits that I make, even without pushing those commits to this remote. It's still a measure of my productivity, but it's definitely not completely consistent with github's standard for this metric. It's actually a broader measure, as it tracks every commit I make regardless of whether or not the github account repositories are current.

#### files follow this format:
```
#log files containing commit messages:
ProjectName::BranchName.log

#data files containing file/insertion/deletion information for each commit:
ProjectName::BranchName.data
```

*another green-ish square...*

I believe that by tracking my daily adherance to some minimal output metric it will be easier for me to maintain a consistent programming habit. This will also promote a more strictly atomic commit format for my work by encouraging smaller more incremental units of work output.
